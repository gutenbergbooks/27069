<h2>ADAM MICKIEWICZ</h2>
<h3>A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VII" id="Page_VII">[VII]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="ADAM_MICKIEWICZ" id="ADAM_MICKIEWICZ"></a>ADAM MICKIEWICZ</h2>

<h3>(1798-1855)</h3>

<p>The last of the eighteenth century was an important
period for Russia and Poland, not only politically,
but in letters and art. It marked the birth of statesmen,
patriots, poets and writers. It was into a Poland of great
names and greater activities that Adam Mickiewicz was
born in 1798, as son of an impoverished family of the old
nobility. Three years before, the third and last partition of
his native land had taken place, and the signed documents
had been hastened to Petersburg to make more triumphant
the birthday of the Great Catherine.</p>

<p>Just a few years before this (1792), Kosciusko had courageously
led his forty-five thousand valiant Poles in their
brave defiance of an overwhelming number of Cossacks
and Russians. History had recorded the bloody Turkish
wars, the Pugatshev rebellion, the uprising of the Zaporogian
Cossacks and the Polish confederations. And with the
nineteenth century came the Napoleonic wars with the
dramatic entry of Napoleon into Russia, and a new and
different mental life began to dawn over Europe.</p>

<p>Mickiewicz was born in Novogrodek in Lithuania. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_VIII" id="Page_VIII">[VIII]</a></span>
was the birthplace of Count Henry Rzewuski, who wrote
the delightful memories of the Polish eighteenth century,
under the title of "The Memories of Pan Severin Soplica,"<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[*]</a>
and who declared he considered it an honor to be born a
"schlazig" (noble) of Lithuania, and of Novogrodek. He
went to a government school in Minsk, and later attended
the University of Vilna, which city in his day was a place
of Jesuit faith, gloomy convents and echoing bells. All
about him epoch-making events for Slav lands were taking
place. It was a resounding, inspired age for his race, and
he grew up to take a fitting place in that age and to be
called "the immortal hero of Polish poetry." Poland just
then was the battle-ground not only for the armies of
Europe, but for the diplomats. It was a place for statesmen
to win their spurs. If accredited to Petersburg or
Warsaw, and successful, they were believed to be equal to
any diplomatic emergency. Eloquence, inspiration, and
patriotic fervor must have cradled his childhood.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[*]</span></a> The full title of the book is: Memories of Pan Severin Soplica, Cupbearer
of Parnau, by Count Henry Rzewuski.</p></div>

<p>At the time of the birth of Mickiewicz, Russia was
bringing to a close a prodigious period of development in
almost every field of human activity. It was really the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_IX" id="Page_IX">[IX]</a></span>
birth-throe of a nation that was to move powerfully, and to
dominate&mdash;partially&mdash;the new age. And the splendid and
never again to be equalled pageant of the life of Catherine
the Great, with its wild dreams of world dominance and of
the glorious revival of perished Greece, had just been unrolled
for the amazement of Europe. What dramatic and
enchanting memories the names of her followers call up:
the Orlows, Potemkin, Panin, Poniatowski, Bestushew-Rjumin,
Princess Daschkov, Razumowski.</p>

<p>In France, too, the same preceding period had been brilliant.
It had been the France of Voltaire, the Encyclopedists,
and a most resplendent and luxurious monarch. England
had known her greatest orators and prime ministers.
It had been the Prussia of Frederick the Great; the Dresden
of August the Strong; the Austria of Joseph the Second.</p>

<p>A little later&mdash;during Mickiewicz's own youth&mdash;Goethe
was at the height of his power and the intellectual dictator
of Europe. Under his direction and encouragement the
treasures of oriental literature were being translated and
made known to the West. This is merely a hasty glimpse of
the "mise-en-scene" that preceded the debut in life of the
most renowned of Polish poets. The old traditions of absolute
and God-created monarchs and princely times were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_X" id="Page_X">[X]</a></span>
coming to an end, and that democratic modern world,
where everything was to change, was close at hand, just
over the crest, indeed, of this new century into which Fate
was ushering him. He was to see the last of blind power
and royal prerogative, and the first dawn of a modern
spirit which in time would sweep away forever, the old.
It was an uncertain, difficult transition period, without
standards and without measurements.</p>

<p>As we take a fleeting, bird's-eye view of the stirring times
in which his days were spent, his travels, his army life,
his periods of professorship, we can not help but wonder at
the amount of writing Mickiewicz did. And his life was
not a long one; it did not reach to sixty years. But during
the working years allotted him, before a mystical melancholy
&mdash;which was threatening to degenerate into madness&mdash;had
impaired his faculties, his mind was unusually brilliant,
creative and marvelously disciplined. It obeyed at
will. At one time he was professor of Latin in Lausanne;
at another time he held the chair of Slavic languages in
Paris. He taught Polish and Latin in Kovno. He traveled
extensively in Italy in the interest of the Polish revolution.
His mind was many-sided and capable of various
activities. He devoted considerable time to advanced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XI" id="Page_XI">[XI]</a></span>
mathematics and philosophy. He made scientific investigations
in Vilna under Lalewel. At one time and another
he lived in various large cities of Europe. In Germany
he met and became friendly with Goethe. In Switzerland
he met Krasinski. In 1833 he married Celina
Szymanovska. Her mother was the famous Slav beauty
and musician who had so delighted Goethe in her youth.</p>

<p>Among writers of Russia and Poland whose life period
somewhat coincided with that of Mickiewicz's are: Korzenowski
(born in 1797), the novelist (a brother of Adam
Mickiewicz was fellow-teacher with Korzenowski at Charkov);
Danilewski (1829), likewise a novelist&mdash;it was he
who translated The Crimean Sonnets into Russian; Malzweski,
Polish patriot and poet, whose "Maria"&mdash;perhaps
the most popular poetic story in Poland&mdash;appeared at
almost the same time as The Crimean Sonnets; Zaleski
(1802), Slowacki (1809), Krasinski (1812), the three
greatest poets of Poland excepting only Mickiewicz himself,
the Polish critic, Brodzinski.</p>

<p>In Russia, the golden age of literature almost covered
the same period as Mickiewicz's own life&mdash;Puschkin,
Lermontov, Schukowski, Gogol, to mention only some of
the most important names.</p>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XII" id="Page_XII">[XII]</a></span>
In the eighteen-thirties we find Mickiewicz in Paris,
which happened to be filled just then with a crowd of brilliant
Slavic exiles. Here he became the friend of Chopin, and
one of Chopin's most talented pupils&mdash;a young Polish girl&mdash;made
the first translation of the Sonnets into French.
It was a wonderful and brilliant Paris which Mickiewicz
entered. This was the time when the city was first called
"the stepmother of Genius." Heine was here in exile, and
B&ouml;rne. It knew the personal fascination and the denunciative
writings of Ferdinand la Salle. It was the day, too, of
Eugene Sue, Berlioz, George Sand, de Musset, Dumas,
Gautier, the Goncourt Brothers, Gavarni, Sainte Beuve,
Liszt, Felix Mendelssohn, Ary Scheffer, Delacroiz, Horace
Vernet&mdash;to mention only a few great names at random.
Julius Slowacki, Count Krasinski and Adam Mickiewicz
were all here editing their poetry in the midst of this
brilliant life in the inspiring city by the Seine. This
period in Paris signs perhaps the high-water mark of the
creative genius of Mickiewicz. He had already written the
Ballads and Romances, the third part of Dziady, Pan
Tadeuz.</p>

<p>The Crimean Sequence belongs to the period of Mickiewicz's
youth, the Vilna period. He joined a society at this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIII" id="Page_XIII">[XIII]</a></span>
time which was looked upon with disfavor by the Government.
At length, because of his continued participation in
it, he was exiled to southern Russia. On that trip, while he
was going toward Odessa, he began the Crimean Sonnets.
Their success was quick and astonishing. They were
translated into every language of Europe. Although the
form is the traditional and classic sonnet form, he makes
use of it in a slightly different manner, not altogether as an
exposition of the sentiments of the soul, and the convictions
and emotions of the mind, but as an instrument with
which to sketch what he saw upon this eventful journey.
He used the sonnet form at that period just as Verhaeren
used it in "Les Flamandes," to show us Flanders, and as
Albert Samain in "Le Chariot d'Or," to picture the gardens
of Versailles. This is worthy of note. And this we
must remember was before 1826. In the poetical works of
Mickiewicz there was always traceable an inclination to
break tradition and to search for new and untried possibilities.</p>

<p>On this exile in Russia he learned to know Puschkin,
then a young man like himself. Puschkin has written a
verse letter to him which we transcribe in free prose. "He
lived among us for a while&mdash;a people strange to him. And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XIV" id="Page_XIV">[XIV]</a></span>
yet his mind cherished no hatred and no longing for revenge.
Generous, kind of heart, noble-minded, he joined
our evening circles, and we loved him. We exchanged our
dreams, our plans&mdash;our poems. God gave him genius and
inspiration. He stood always on the heights and looked
down on life. We talked of history and of nations. He
declared a time would come when races would forget all
evil things&mdash;like war, rebellion&mdash;and dwell together peaceably
in one great family. We listened to him eagerly for he
had the gift of speech. After a while he went away and we
gave our blessing to him. Then we learned our guest&mdash;spurred
on by his revengeful race&mdash;had become our enemy.
To please that bitter race of his he filled his songs with
hatred. Of our beloved friend there came to us only revenge
and angry thoughts. God grant that peace may come
again to his embittered heart!"</p>

<p>Puschkin himself wrote eloquently of these same Crimean
scenes that Mickiewicz shows us. He, too, was inspired
by the old capital city of the Tartar rulers. We
recall his "Fountain of Baktschi Serai." And he, too,
brings before our eyes again that gigantic mountain world
of southern Russia in "The Prisoner of the Caucasus."</p>

<p>The fame of The Crimean Sonnets was so great that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_XV" id="Page_XV">[XV]</a></span>
Mickiewicz was offered a government position which attached
him to the person of the powerful Prince Galitzin,
in Moscow. It was in Rome, and singularly enough it was
when he wrote the "Ode to Youth" that he began to devote
himself to mystical studies which had such an injurious
effect upon his mind. For some time after he had lost his
fluent power as a poet, he retained his conversational gifts
which were remarkable and brought him almost as much
fame as his poetry. His life ended in a period as dramatic
as that in which it began. He entered the Turkish wars in
1855 and died in Stamboul in that same year. It is somewhat
peculiar and at the same time no little to his credit
that he should have chosen the sonnet as the instrument of
his quick sketching of Crimea on the trip of exile, because
the sonnet has never been a frequently chosen means of expression
of the Slav races, despite the numerous sonnets
written later by Vrchlicky, Preseren and others. The sonnet
has belonged more to the Latin races, and to the English
race. The Crimean Sonnets, however, rank among the
famous sequences.</p>

Across sea-meadows measureless I go,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">My wagon sinking under grass so tall</span><br />
The flowery petals in foam on me fall,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And blossom-isles float by I do not know.</span><br />
No pathway can the deepening twilight show;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I seek the beckoning stars which sailors call,</span><br />
And watch the clouds. What lies there brightening all?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Dneister's, the steppe-ocean's evening glow!</span><br />
</p>

<p>
The silence! I can hear far flight of cranes&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">So far the eyes of eagle could not reach&mdash;</span><br />
And bees and blossoms speaking each to each;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The serpent slipping adown grassy lanes;</span><br />
From my far home if word could come to me!&mdash;<br />

As any bride who dreams at love's behest,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And wakes and sighs, then casts with dreams her lot.</span><br />
Sails hang upon the masts&mdash;useless&#8212;forgot&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like folded standards which the warriors wrest</span><br />
And bring home broken from the battle's crest.<br />

<p>
O Sea! within your unknown deeps concealed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When storms are wild, your monsters dream and sleep,</span><br />
And all their cruelty for the sunlight keep.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Thus, Soul of Mine, in your sad deeps concealed</span><br />
The monsters sleep&mdash;when wild are storms. They start<br />

What would Great Allah with the frozen sea?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Would he of icy clouds a throne carve bright,</span><br />
Or would the demons of the deepest night<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A bar build where the shining stars sweep free?</span><br />
It gleams like pagan cities fired, kings flee.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When Day was anciently destroyed by Night</span><br />
Did Allah amid chaos fix this light<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To guide the star-worlds of eternity?</span><br />
</p>

<p>(Mirza)</p>

<p>
Up there I've journeyed where the winter reigns,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And seen the rivers bitten black like lines</span><br />
On Tschatir Dagh, where the white cloud reclines,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which not the wildest eagle's shadow stains,</span><br />

Within the burnished banquet room there sings<br />

And on an Arab steed the wild Khan rides<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who goes to Baktschi Serai which night hides.</span><br />

<p>
In Spring of love and life, My Polish Rose,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">You faded and forgot the joy of youth;</span><br />
Bright butterfly, it brushed you, then left ruth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of bitter memory that stings and glows.</span><br />
O Stars! that seek a path my northland knows,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">How dare you now on Poland shine forsooth,</span><br />
When she who loved you and lent you her youth<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sleeps where beneath the wind the long grass blows?</span><br />
</p>

<p>
Alone, My Polish Rose, I die, like you.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Beside your grave a while pray let me rest</span><br />
With other wanderers at some grief's behest.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The tongue of Poland by your grave rings true.</span><br />
High-hearted, now a young boy past it goes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of you it is he sings, My Polish Rose.</span><br />

They sleep well here whom Allah loved and kept<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And treasured in his vineyard fair and fine,</span><br />
Most lustrous of the Orient pearls that shine,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Which youth found where the waves of passion swept.</span><br />
Here, where in peace perpetual they have slept,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A turban beckons where the roses twine,</span><br />
A banner flutters out in silken line,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And sometimes here a Giaour's name is kept.</span><br />
</p>

<p>
Oh! roses of this paradise of old,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The eyes that loved not Allah saw you not,</span><br />
Nor arms that prayed not eastward could enfold!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">But now a Christian treads this hallowed spot;</span><br />
Wise Allah, curse not him who bows his head<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Amid the marble shrines of Allah's dead!</span><br />

Give wings unto the storm, and spurs to steed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I'd move unchained as wind across the world,</span><br />
Sweep onward like a torrent mountain-hurled,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Nor sea, nor height, nor valley pause to heed.</span><br />
The twilight spreads a dimness o'er our speed,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And shows the diamond-stars from hoofs up-whirled,</span><br />
Since daylight now her curtained blue has juried,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And mystery and magic shadows breed.</span><br />
</p>

<p>
The earth sleeps, but not I&mdash;not I&mdash;not I&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Who hasten to the shore where waves are loud</span><br />
And toward me in the darkness whitely crowd.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Beneath them I would still my soul's deep cry&mdash;</span><br />
Like ships the whirlpools seize to drag to death&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I'd plunge within the silence, sans thought, breath.</span><br />

The mighty mountain flings its mist-veil down;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With little flowers the gracious fields are bright,</span><br />
And from the forest colors flash to sight<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Like gems that drop from off a Calif's crown.</span><br />
Upon the meadows settles shimmering down<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A band of butterflies in rainbow flight;</span><br />
Cicadas call and call in day's delight,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And bees are dreaming in a blossom's crown.</span><br />
</p>

<p>
The waves beneath the cliff are thunder-pale,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Now upward, upward in their rage they rise</span><br />
And tawny are their crests as tigers' eyes.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The sun is focused on one white, far sail</span><br />
And on blue, shining deeps as smooth as glass<br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">On Tschatir Dagh the sullen sun and low</span><br />
Paints phantom purple upon ancient snow;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">While forest ways within, the wanderers hide.</span><br />
Night veils the mountains and the valleys wide;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The thunderous brooks are dream-held, dulled, and slow;</span><br />
Beneath the blackness fragrant flowers blow<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And rich leaf-music clothes each valley side.</span><br />
</p>

<p>
Almost my waking eyes are dream-held too;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With gold a meteor marks the deep-domed sky</span><br />
And fountain-like the fiery sparks float by.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Oh! Beauty of the Eastern Night, you woo</span><br />
My spirit like the odalisque, who held<br />

In bright mist mantled from the toe to lip,<br />

If winter rule the world, or summer's sun,<br />

Below me half a world I see outspread;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Above, blue heaven; around, peaks of snow;</span><br />
And yet the happy pulse of life is slow,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I dream of distant places, pleasures dead.</span><br />
The woods of Lithuania I would tread<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where happy-throated birds sing songs I know;</span><br />
Above the trembling marshland I would go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Where chill-winged curlews dip and call o'er head.</span><br />
</p>

<p>
A tragic, lonely terror grips my heart,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A longing for some peaceful, gentle place,</span><br />
And memories of youthful love I trace.<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Unto my childhood home I long to start,</span><br />
And yet if all the leaves my name could cry<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">She would not pause nor heed as she passed by.</span><br />

Pray! Pray! Let loose the bridle. Look not down!<br />

Pray, and look upward to the mountain's crown!<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The deep below is endless where you peer;</span><br />
Stretch not the hand out as you pass, for fear<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The added weight of that might plunge you down.</span><br />

And check your thoughts' free flight, too, while you go;<br />
